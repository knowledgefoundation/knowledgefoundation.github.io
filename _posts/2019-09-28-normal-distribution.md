A **continuous random variable** X is one that can assume an infinite number of values within any given interval. The probability that X falls within any interval is given by the area under the probability distribution (or density function) within that interval.

The **normal distribution** is a continuous probability distribution and the most commonly used distribution in statistical analysis. The normal curve is **bell-shaped and symmetrical about its mean**. It extends indefinitely in both directions, but most of the area (probability) is clustered around the mean 68.26% of the area (probability) under the normal curve is included within one standard deviation of the mean (i.e., within μ ± 1σ), 95.44% within μ ± 2σ, and 99.74% within μ ± 3σ.

The **standard normal distribution** is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 (i.e., μ = 0 and σ = 1). Any normal distribution can be converted into a standard normal distribution by letting μ = 0 and expressing deviations from μ in standard deviation units (z scale).
