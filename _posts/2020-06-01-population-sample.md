## Population  

It is the complete set of numerical information on a particular quantity in which we as an analyst are interested  

### Example 1 - Population  

Suppose we would like to understand the average height of all males in India, then the population would represent all males residing in India  

### Example 2 - Population  

Suppose we would like to understand the percentage of votes that a certain candidate would get for an election within a certain constituency. For this population would represent  all voters of the constituency.
